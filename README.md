# ScreenShare
Share your screen as a texture via the Spout texture sharing framework. 

This OpenFrameworks application uses the Spout texture sharing framework and windows GDI+ api calls to capture your computer screen and shares it via Spout. Any receiving Spout enabled application can take this shared screen and do what they wish with it.

This initial release is just designed as the proof of concept. New features are on the drawing board, including the ability to select a portion of the screen to share and the ability to use different capture screen capture techniques (for speed).
